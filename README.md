# 1. Introduction:
## 1.1 Purpose of the project:
Pharmacy management system is a management system that is designed to improve
accuracy and to enhance safety and efficiency in the pharmaceutical store. It is a
computer based system which helps the Pharmacist to improve inventory management,
cost, medical safety etc.
## 1.2 Summary of the problem:
At present, a manual system is being utilized in the pharmacy. It requires the pharmacist
to manually monitor each drug that is available in the pharmacy. This usually leads to
mistakes as the workload of the pharmacist increases.
## 1.3 Summary of the solution:
The system allows the user to enter a manufacturing and expiry date for a particular
product or drug during opening stock and sales transaction. The system will also give a
report showing the list of products expiring after a specified date before the product
eventually expires. It also involves manual entry upon arrival of new batches of drugs
and upon drug movement out of the pharmacy for a certain period, e.g. every month, the
pharmacist may want to generate report for the movement of drugs in and out of the
pharmacy, getting information about the drugs e.g. expiry date, date purchased, number
of drug type left, location of a drug in the pharmacy.

# 2. Motivation:
## 2.1 History behind the development:
Due to the size and quality service of the pharmacy, the pharmacy has a very large
customer base. These customers tend to visit the pharmacy for services mostly when they
close from work. At this period, the number of customers that patronize the pharmacy is
on the increase, thereby making the workload of the pharmacists much more tedious.
This case makes it difficult for the pharmacist to attend to customers in a short period.
Meanwhile the pharmacist has to ensure satisfaction in services to keep their customers.
The factors mentioned above result in delay of the services being rendered to the
customers, thereby slowing down sales and risk losing valuable customers in the long
run.That’s why we decided to do this project.
## 2.2 Importance of the project:
Pharmacy management has kept paper records in filing cabinets. Managing a very large
pharmacy with records on papers will be tedious and difficult to keep track of inventories
with regards to the drugs in the store, expiry date, quantity of drugs available based on
the categories and their functions.
This project work will prompt the pharmacist about drugs that are close to expiry,
preventing those drugs from being sold and also providing solutions to the earlier stated
problems.
## 2.3 Reason for the problem occur:
The pharmacist has to order drugs to replenish the already diminishing stock. In addition,
ordering of drugs is being carried out manually. Significant amount of time is allocated
for writing the order as the pharmacist needs to go through the stock balance and make a
rough estimate of the amount to order based on Figures.Drugs are not supposed to be
used after they have expired. These are the reasons why the manual system of pharmacy
management causes many problems.
## 2.4 Solution that currently exist:
There is a lot more existing software to this related problem which involves essential
management and these days they are helping a pharmacist to manage things easily. These
software’s are very much effective which help to save time the most.

## 2.5 Reason for the success of our solution:
As there is a lot more solution to this problem why would we choose this one and this is a
good question. We are trying to develop a user-friendly system and trying to add some
new features and more suitable software for the pharmacists and consumers so that they
do not have to panic or have to face any problem even after a lot of entries. Some of the
existing software has this kind of problem. We are focusing on the users the most and
give them a better service, better user interface ,and advanced security.
Our only aim is to give a better service to our users where they can use it frequently
without any kind of hesitation. This one is going to be a user-friendly management
system.As we have already mentioned about why we need it, it is for the betterment of
business and saving time.
## 2.6 Improvement of the current solutions:
Web Base System Limited Access to Customers Order detail information Cash Balance
Information More details of users and suppliers Barcode reader Cheques and Credit card.
## 2.7 Achiveness:
The aim of this project is to develop a software for the effective management of a
pharmaceutical store that will be able to achieve the following objectives:
● Ensuring effective policing by providing statistics of the drugs in stock.
● Maintaining the correct database by providing an option to update the drugs in
stock.
● Improving the efficiency of the system by ensuring effective monitoring of
services and activities.
● To provide optimal drug inventory management by monitoring the drug movement
in the pharmacy.
● To ensure that there exists a level of restricted access based on functionality and
role.
● To ensure that the system is user friendly.
● To be able to generate reports within a specified period of time.

# 3. Project Details
## 3.1 Environment:
Project environment represents a connection, where the project is processed. It impacts
the project and is, therefore, conditioned. Such an interaction is provided by numerous
factors as operational, physical, ecological, social, cultural, economic, psychological,
financial, organizational etc.
### 3.1.1 Languages, Software and Hardware:
We will be using c#.net through visual studio in programming language C# (C sharp). We
will also need MySQL as the required database and object-oriented concept will be
followed.

## 3.2 Issues and challenges for implementation :
### 3.2.1 Problem occur in the process:
we face many problem by implementation this code
### 3.2.2 Use of existent tools and systems:
We used MySql,Net Framework 4.7.2 for making database, visual studio for C# I
also used Windows 10 for this project.
6
### 3.2.3 Special about project
Pharmacy Shop Management System Project is computer-based software developed for
managing, monitoring and recording various activities of medical stores. It plays a key
role in improving the productivity of medical stores through automated functions. It is
time friendly and easy to use. We can also print the data as a document.It also helps to
overcome the manual pharmacy management issues.
## 3.3 Deliverables:
### 3.3.1 Conclusive evidence from this project:
